The palladium catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, and CO chemisorption. MIL-101 is highly hydrophilic and beneficial as support for fine Pd nanoparticles with an average size of 2.3nm. Microporous MIL-53 is relatively hydrophobic and larger Pd particles with an average size of 4.3nm were formed on the external surface. Pd/MIL-101 showed better phenol selective hydrogenation activity to cyclohexanone (98%) under mild reaction conditions because of its smaller particle size.\n","Extract information:\n","name_of_mof: MIL-101, mof_formula: , mof_description: [], guest_species: [], applications: [catalysts, phenol hydrogenation]}, {name_of_mof: MIL-53, mof_formula: , mof_description: [], guest_species: [], applications: [catalysts, phenol hydrogenation]}, {name_of_mof: Pd/MIL-101, mof_formula: , mof_description: [], guest_species: [], applications: [catalysts, phenol hydrogenation]\n","\n","Text: Molecular insight into the adsorption of H2S in the flexible MIL-53(Cr) and rigid MIL-47(V) MOFs: Infrared spectroscopy combined to molecular simulations\n","The adsorption of the acid gas H2S has been explored in both MIL-47(V) and MIL-53(Cr) porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by combining infrared measurements and molecular simulations. It is shown that while the MIL-47(V) structure remains rigid upon H2S adsorption up to a pressure of 1.8 MPa, the MIL-53(Cr) solid initially present in the large pore form (LP) switches to its narrow pore version (NP) at very low pressure before undergoing a second structural transition from the NP to the LP versions at higher pressure. Such structural transitions further explain the different shape of the adsorption isotherms for both MILs. A further step consists of providing some insights into the microscopic arrangements of the adsorbate molecules within the pores of the MILs. At the initial stage of adsorption, the H 2S molecules mainly form hydrogen bonded species, either as hydrogen donor (in MIL-47 V) or hydrogen-acceptor (in MIL-53Cr) with the μ2-O and μ2-OH groups, respectively, present at the MOF surfaces. At higher pressure (1.8 MPa), the adsorbates are preferentially arranged within the channel in order to form dimers with a high orientational disorder. Both experimental and simulated adsorption enthalpies for H 2S decrease in the following sequence: MIL-53(Cr) NP > MIL-47(V) > MIL-53(Cr) LP. The conclusions drawn from this work are then discussed considering the use of such materials for the CH4/H2S separation by means of Pressure Swing Adsorption. © 2011 American Chemical Society.\n","Extract information:\n","name_of_mof: MIL-53(Cr), mof_formula: , mof_description: [], guest_species: [H2S], applications: [adsorption of H2S, CH4/H2S separation]}, {name_of_mof: MIL-47(V), mof_formula: , mof_description: [], guest_species: [H2S], applications: [adsorption of H2S, CH4/H2S separation]\n","\n","Text: Hydrogen physisorption in high SSA microporous materials – A comparison between AX-21_33 and MOF-177 at cryogenic conditions\n","The two most promising materials for a hydrogen cryo-adsorption tank, activated carbon AX-21_33 and metal-organic framework MOF-177, have been investigated in the pressure range up to 2 MPa and at temperatures from 77 K to 125 K and at room temperature. The total hydrogen storage, including adsorbed hydrogen and gaseous hydrogen, has been determined for both samples. The results were evaluated with respect to the operating conditions of a tank system at cryogenic conditions, assuming a maximum tank pressure of 2 MPa and a minimum back pressure for the hydrogen consumer of 0.2 MPa. AX-21_33 shows a usable capacity of 3.5 wt.% in the case of isothermal operation at 77 K and 5.6 wt.%, if the tank is loaded at 77 K and the temperature is increased by 40 K during unloading. Under the same conditions, MOF-177 has a usable capacity of 6.1 wt.% and 7.4 wt.%, respectively.

In this study, cubic and tetragonal structures of MOF-5 (C-MOF-5 and T-MOF-5) were successfully synthesized, characterized and incorporated into cellulose acetate (CA) polymer matrix in the range of 6, 9 and 12 wt % to fabricate mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). The effects of smaller pore size of T-MOF- 5 and more ZnO molecules in T-MOF-5, on the H2 and CO2 permeation properties of C-MOF-5/CA and T-MOF-5/CA MMMs were investigated. The all novel MMMs were prepared using the solution casting method and characterized by FTIR, TGA and SEM. SEM images as well as results of FTIR and TGA analyses confirmed good adhesion between both MOF-5s and CA matrix. Addition of both C-MOF-5 and T-MOF-5 into the CA improved the gas transport properties of the CA, especially in H2 separation. The H2/CO2 selectivity continued the increasing trend at 9 wt % and did not significantly reduce even at 12 wt % due to good adhesion between both MOF-5s and CA. The highest H2/CO2 selectivity was obtained at 12 and 9 wt % loading of C-MOF-5 and T-MOF-5, respectively. By changing the filler from C-MOF-5 to T-MOF-5, the increasing and reducing of adsorption site of H2and CO2 (respectively), and also reducing in pore size, caused the appearance of H2 permeability to not change much but the CO2 permeability to reduce. Accordingly, the H2/CO2 selectivity in all T-MOF-5/CA MMMs is higher than that in all C-MOF-5/CA MMMs. According to obtained results, the activated MOFs (i.e., C-MOF-5 in this study) are not always the best choices for separation process.\n","Extract information:\n","name_of_mof: MOF-5, mof_formula: , mof_description: [cubic and tetragonal structures], guest_species: [], applications: [H2/CO2 separation, separation]}, {name_of_mof: C-MOF-5, mof_formula: , mof_description: [cubic structures], guest_species: [], applications: [H2/CO2 separation, separation]}, {name_of_mof: T-MOF-5, mof_formula: , mof_description: [tetragonal structures], guest_species: [], applications: [H2/CO2 separation, separation]\n","\n","Text: Facet-dependent catalytic activity of ZIF-8 nanocubes and rhombic dodecahedra based on tracing substrate diffusion in pores by SERS: a case study for surface catalysis of MOFs\n","We employed ZIF-8 rhombic dodecahedra and nanocubes as catalysts to obtain insights into the surface catalysis of MOFs based on facet-dependent catalytic activity for Knoevenagel condensation.
